## When creating functions:

* Give your functions precise verb/action based names
* Use `camelCasedNames` (like this one)
* Properly indent the function code
* Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect. _Break your function into additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things._
  * One single task could be to compute and return a value
  * Another single task could be to perform a side effect such as logging a message to the screen

Always keep these rules in mind :)
