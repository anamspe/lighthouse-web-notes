## Truthy and Falsey

Most things in JavaScript are considered `Truthy`, except for the following:

_All of the following are inherently falsey:_

* False  
_False is False. Makes sense, right?_

* `0`  
_0 is the only falsey number_

* `""`  
_an empty string is falsey_

* `null`  
_a null, or empty value, is falsey._

* `undefined`  
_an object that has not been defined is considered falsey_

* `NaN`  
_Not a Number._
